# Overview
This is a couple of scripts/configs to fully automate window configurations (size/postion) for all the windows on your Linux desktop.  The instructions for using this are included in the wiki linked below.

**IMPORTANT**: As of this writing, this will only work with X11, **NOT** Wayland desktops.  I'm open to suggestions on how to accomplish the same thing with Wayland, in which I would update the scripts to be display manager agnostic.
